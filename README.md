#Â monetary.js

> Responsible money handling in JavaScript!

## Important note

This library is under heavy development. It is not ready for productive
usage yet!

If you'd like to use `monetary.js` as soon as possible feel free to contribute
to the project!
I appreciate any kind of help.

## Introduction

Out of the need for a JavaScript money handling library,
`monetary.js` was introduced to simplify parsing, validation, manipulation and
displaying of money amounts in different currencies.
